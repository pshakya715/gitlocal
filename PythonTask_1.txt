''' If one data type value is assigned to 'a' variable and then a
different data type value is assigned to 'a' again, the value of 'a'
will change. A variable is a name that represents a value stores in the
computer' memory. They are known as variable because they can
reference different values while a program is running. When a 
value is assigned to a variable, it will reference that value until
it it is assigned a different value.'''
